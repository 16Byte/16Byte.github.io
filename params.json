Long time since I've updated this website! I just wanted to talk a little bit about what my goals have been in making games and what the future of game development holds for me. I started making games at the age of 9. I make games for personal joy of putting my feelings and deepest desires into an interactive platform that I can play through. It's the equivalent of someone writing a song. The entire time I've started making games people have asked when will I be releasing my games, my answer is always simply I won't be. Not because I don't think they would do well but because I always make games to push my limits and I am always putting my deepest feelings into my game and in a way I'm scared to share that with the world. \r\n\r\n##  So what does this mean for the future of my game development \"career\"? I am going to keep making games for my pleasure but, I have recently decided to make the game of all games. The one that I put my heart and sole into so you all can see what I love doing most. So in this article I confirm that I will be working on a new game that is not fully planned out yet but will be developed and released sometime next year or the beginning of next year, or just whenever I feel like it to be honest. \r\n\r\n-Diego Jimenez\r\n16Byte\r\n\r\n# 07/27/2015: Funding\r\n\r\n## I'll be honest I want/need to make a kickstarter but like I have nothing to give you guys lol. I'll just Make a donate button on this site if you guys feel like donating.\r\n\r\n# 07/27/2015: Small Game Planned\r\n\r\n## I've planned to make a small game so that you guys can play with it until Simplicity is ready for testing. It should be ready in about 1 month or less if I keep working on it while all of the preparations are made for Simplicity.\r\n\r\n# 07/27/2015 Currently Working on Simplicity!\r\n\r\n## Simplicity is a game I've been thinking about/Making since I was 11. I'm finally proud to say that I will be working on it full time! If you would like to see more of this message or follow me on twitter.\r\n","google":"UA-65678324-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
