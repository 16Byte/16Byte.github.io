Long time since I've updated this website! I just wanted to talk a little bit about what my goals have been in making games and what the future of game development holds for me. I started making games at the age of 9. I make games for personal joy of putting my feelings and deepest desires into an interactive platform that I can play through. It's the equivalent of someone writing a song. The entire time I've started making games people have asked when will I be releasing my games, my answer is always simply I won't be. Not because I don't think they would do well but because I always make games to push my limits and I am always putting my deepest feelings into my game and in a way I'm scared to share that with the world.</h2>

So in this article I confirm that I will be working on a new game that is not fully planned out yet but will be developed and released sometime next year or the beginning of next year, or just whenever I feel like it to be honest.</h2>
